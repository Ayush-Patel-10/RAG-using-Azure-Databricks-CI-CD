# RAG-using-Azure-Databricks-CI-CD


# Introduction

The project leverages the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework which we are incorporating within our chatbot on Azure Databricks. This approach ensures our chatbot delivers responses that are relevant and contextually precise, while also enabling continuous integration and deployment for streamlined development and updates. This model, integrated within a serverless architecture and supported by Delta Tables for secure data storage and enhances the chatbot's efficiency and scalability while ensuring stringent data security and compliance. Employing MLFlow for lifecycle management further ensures that each model iteration is meticulously tracked and documented, we have leveraged MLFlow's LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating our RAG chatbot.

## Project Overview

This repository houses the `RAG-using-Azure-Databricks-CI-CD` project, which demonstrates a comprehensive MLOps pipeline encompassing development, production, and monitoring within an Azure Databricks environment.


## Getting Started - Setup Guide

To begin working with the `RAG-using-Azure-Databricks-CI-CD` project, please follow the initial setup instructions detailed in the guide below:

- [Project Setup Guide on Azure & Databricks](https://github.com/Ayush-Patel-10/RAG-using-Azure-Databricks-CI-CD/blob/main/README/SETUP.md)

This guide covers creating an Azure account, setting up resource groups, storage accounts, and Databricks workspaces, as well as configuring GitHub secrets and local development tools like the Databricks CLI.

After completing the initial setup, you can proceed to the detailed aspects of the project using the Table of Contents.

## Databricks Folder Structure

The projectâ€™s folder structure in Databricks is designed to separate files and artifacts across the test, staging, and prod environments, facilitating organized development and deployment.

## Terraform

Terraform is used for infrastructure provisioning and state management within our Databricks environment.

[Review our Terraform practices](https://github.com/Ayush-Patel-10/RAG-using-Azure-Databricks-CI-CD/blob/main/README/README_TERRAFORM_TFSTATE.md)


## CI/CD Workflow

Our project utilizes a CI/CD pipeline that orchestrates the workflow from development to staging and production.

## Model Version Rollback

Our process for rolling back to previous model versions in production is documented to ensure reliability and ease of transitions.

[Learn about model version rollback](https://github.com/Ayush-Patel-10/RAG-using-Azure-Databricks-CI-CD/blob/main/README/README_MODEL_VERSION_ROLLBACK.md)



## MLFlow

MLFlow is integral to our pipeline, providing tools for model versioning, management, and serving in both test and production environments.
